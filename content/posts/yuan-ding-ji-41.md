I long to speak the deepest words I have to say to you ;
But I dare not, for fear you should laugh. 
That is why I laugh at myself and shatter my secret in jest. 
I make light of my pain, afraid you should do so.

I long to tell you the truest words I have to say to you; 
But I dare not, being afraid that you would not believe them. 
That is why I disguise them in untruth, 
Saying the contrary of what I mean. 
I make my pain appear absurd, afraid that you should do so. 

I long to use the most precious words I have for you; 
But I dare not, fearing I should not be paid with like value. 
That is why I gave you hard names and boast of my boast of my callous strength. 
I hurt you, for fear you should never know any pain. 

I long to sit silent by you; 
But I dare not lest my heart come out at my lips. 
That is why I prattle and chatter lightly and hide my heart behind words. 
I rudely handle my pain, for fear you should do so. 

I long to go away from your side; 
But I dare not, for fear my cowardice should become known to you. 
That is why I hold my head high and carelessly come into your presence. 
Constant thrusts from your eyes keep my pain fresh forever. 


我想对你说出我要说的最深的话语； 
我不敢，我怕你嘲笑。 
因此我嘲笑自己，把我的秘密在玩笑中打碎。 
我把我的痛苦说得轻松，因为怕你会这样做。 

我想对你说出最真的话语； 
我不敢，我怕你不信。 
因此我弄真成假，说出和我的真心相反的話， 
我把我的痛苦说得可笑，因为我怕你会这样做。 

我想用最宝贵的词语來形容你， 
我不敢，我怕得不到相当的酬報 。 
因此我給你安上苛刻的名字，而显示我的硬骨。 
我伤害你，因为怕你永远不知道我的痛苦。 

我想静默地坐在你的身旁； 
我不敢，怕我的心会跳到我的唇上。 
因此我轻松地说东道西，把我的心藏在语言的后面。 
我粗暴的对待我的痛苦，因为我怕你会这样做。 

我想从你身后走开； 
我不敢，怕你看出我的怯懦。 
因此我随意地昂着头走到你的面前。 
从你眼里频频掷來的刺激，使我的痛苦永远新鮮。
